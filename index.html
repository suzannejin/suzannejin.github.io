<!-- Menu Overlay (Refactored to dropdowns inside pages, but keeping this if needed for global fallback, though plan said remove) -->
<!-- Actually, the plan was to remove the global overlay and use the includes which now have the dropdowns. -->
<!-- The includes (nav.html) have the dropdown structure. -->
